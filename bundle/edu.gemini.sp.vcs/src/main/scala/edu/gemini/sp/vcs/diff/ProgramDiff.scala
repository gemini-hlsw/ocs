  /** Returns a (super-set) of differences between two programs.
    *
    * It is a "super-set" because ultimately not every returned `Diff` may be
    * necessary for merging program versions.
    *
    * Each instance/copy of a program has its own unique id.  Each node in a
    * program maintains a map from unique program id to a counter representing
    * the number of edits made to the node in the associated program instance.
    * This map is called `NodeVersions`, a type alias for a
    * [[edu.gemini.shared.util.VersionVector]] keyed by unique program id with
    * `java.lang.Integer` values.  A map of all the `NodeVersions` keyed by the
    * node's `SPNodeKey` is a `VersionMap`. An edit to either the node's "data
    * object" or child list increments the counter associated with the program's
    * unique id.
    *
    * This method compares a local program with the `VersionMap` of a remote
    * copy of the program. It generates `Diff` objects to describe the
    * differences and allow the remote program to incorporate any changes that
    * have been made locally.
    *
    * There are two types of `Diff` objects, `Present` and `Missing`.  A
    * `Present` diff refers to a node that exists in the local program while
    * `Missing` diffs are no longer reachable in the local program.
    *
    * The comparison must generate
    *
    * - `Missing` diffs for any node not in the local program that either (a)
    * is still in the remote program or (b) has different version information
    * than the remote program.
    *
    * - `Present` diffs for any node in the local program with different
    * version information than its remote counterpart.
    *
    * - `Present` diffs for all nodes in an observation that have at least one
    * contained node with a difference in version data.  In other words, any
    * difference in an observation will bring `Present` diffs for the entire
    * observation.
    *
    * - `Present` diffs for all ancestor nodes of a node with different version
    * data.  For example, an edited note in a group will pull in the group and
    * the program ancestors.
    *
    * Conversely, the comparison must not
    *
    * - include `Present` diffs for any node which has the same version
    * information as the remote node and which has no descendants with different
    * version data
    *
    * - include `Missing` diffs for nodes deleted both locally and remotely and
    * that have the same version data
    *
    * @param local local program from which differences are to be extracted
    *
    * @param remoteVm `VersionMap` of the remote instance of the program
    *
    * @param remoteRemoved `Set` of all node keys that are not present in the
    *                     remote instance of the program
    *
    * @return super-set of `Diff`s between the local and remote program
    *         instances
