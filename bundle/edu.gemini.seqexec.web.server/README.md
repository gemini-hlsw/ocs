## Seqexec Web Server

This bundle contains a web-based seqexec client. It is intended to run in the same process as the seqexec-server

### How to run the server with live reloading

Go to the bundle project

```
    project bundle_edu_gemini_seqexec_web_server
    ~re-start
```

Now every time a file is changed the files will be compiled and the server restarted
