Last update: 2021 September 22, Julia Scharwaechter

Target and conditions information from the Phase I observations only
needs to be entered into the template science observations. Daytime
calibrations must have special target names and flux standard
observations must not include target components.

The OT libraries have different acquisition observations for different
acquisition strategies (point source, blind offset, 2 targets,
extended source).  The template library uses a standard point source
acquisition as the default.

Observations are now identified by library IDs, indicated with {}
