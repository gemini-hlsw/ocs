Version 2012 Jun 15 - Updated by Atsuko N and Bryan M
Version 2014 Dec 11 - BMiller, specific setting conditions from PI (change to add science conditions to tellurics)
Version 2015 Apr 29 - Updated to use K-band mag limits and blind-offset acquisition by Marie L.-B. and Andy S

Observations identified by LibraryIDs indicated with {}.

# DEFINITIONS
AO = Adaptive Optics
PI = Phase I

TARGET BRIGHTNESS = TB
Use K magnitude from target information if available:
IF      K <= 9  then BT = True   # Bright Target
IF  9 < K <= 13 then MT = True   # Moderate Target
IF 13 < K <= 20 then FT = True   # Faint Target
IF 20 < K       then BAT = True  # Blind acquisition target

# General Info about the names used in the Acq/Obs
#
# In acquisition observations:
#      K <= 9    NO SKY
#  9 < K <= 13   SKY SUBTRACTION
# 13 < K <= 20   FLIP MIRROR IN
#
# In science observations:
# BRIGHT = BRIGHT READ MODE
# MEDIUM = MEDIUM READ MODE
# FAINT = FAINT READ MODE

# Select acquisition and science observation
