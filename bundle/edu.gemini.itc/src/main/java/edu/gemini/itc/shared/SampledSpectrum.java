/**
 * The SampledSpectrum interface represents a spectral energy distribution.
 * A SampledSpectrum can conceptually be thought of as a 2-D spectrum
 * (data points on axes of real numbers) where the data points occur
 * at regular intervals on the x axis.
 * This interface provides functionality for defining and manipulating a
 * SampledSpectrum.
 * Units are not stored for either axis so the client must know from context.
 * The SampledSpectrum plays the rold of Element in a visitor pattern.
 * This pattern is used to separate operations from the SampledSpectrum
 * elements.
