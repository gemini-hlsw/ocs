# Mapping wavelength to order for GNIRS
# Columns are (1) order, (2) starting and (3) ending wavelengths in nm
# Based on filter cutoffs (SDN0003-23) and (ideal?) grating response 
#  (from Ming's Optical design document); there are large gaps between
#  the filters-- I have either split the difference or assigned the
#  wavespace to the order with better grating response in order to
#  provide continuous wavelength coverage (although clearly the signal
#  will be very low or non-existent in between filters 
#
#  NOTE: there are no order 7 & 8 filters, but wavelength coverage does extend
#        below 800nm in the cross-dispersed mode
