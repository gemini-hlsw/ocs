# Average throughput for the GNIRS Short Red camera
# Columns are (1) wavelength in nm, (2) throughput
# Values from J. Elias sensitivity table with zeroes added at 700 and 6000 nm.
# Table seperates Long vs Short camera at each lambda; here
#  I have used only the L&M values and 50% for K (as a guess)
