<h3><a name="coating">Mirror coating</a> </h3>

<p>The Gemini coating chamber is capable of depositing either alumini(u)m or silver.
Currently the primary, secondary and tertiary (science fold) mirrors on both
telescopes are silver coated. On the <a href="../../../telescope/telPerformance.html">telescope
performance page</a> is a graph showing the reflectivity of Al and Ag.</p>

<h3><a name="port">Instrument port</a> </h3>

<p>Gemini facility instruments may be mounted either on a side-looking or the up-looking ports of
the instrument support structure (ISS). When mounted on a side port they are fed by
reflection off the science fold mirror which incurs an additional small loss in
transmission and an associated increase in emissivity. For signal-to-noise calculations
it should be assumed that the instrument is side-looking.&nbsp;The default
location for mid-IR instruments (e.g. T-ReCS, Michelle) is the up-looking port
and is the side port for other instruments.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="wfs">Wavefront sensor</a> </h3>

<p>Use of a peripheral wavefront sensor (PWFS) or an on-instrument wavefront sensor
(OIWFS) is required to provide tip-tilt error signals for the image motion compensation by
the secondary mirror. Not all instruments have an OIWFS; see the specific instrument pages
for details. When present, the OIWFS allows selection of a WFS star closer to the science
field and therefore usually provides better image motion compensation and smaller images
(see the <a href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/obsConstraints.html#Image Quality">image
quality section</a> of the observing condition constraints for more details). </p>
