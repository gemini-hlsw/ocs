<h3><a name="optical">GNIRS Optical Properties</a> </h3>

<p>The optical elements of GNIRS (e.g. cameras, gratings, cross-dispersing
prisms and slits) are described in
detail on the <a href="../../nirs/nirsComponents.html">GNIRS components</a>
pages. </p>

<p>The choice of camera, grating and slit width set the spectral resolution. Not all
combinations are viable. Use of the cross-dispersing prism may be toggled
on/off (again, only some combinations of prism, grating and camera are viable).
Given a specific central wavelength, the choice of &quot;blue&quot; or
&quot;red&quot; optimised camera, grating order and order sorting filter is made
automatically. A broad-bandpass filter is used with the cross-dispersing prisms. </p>

<p>Note that even though specific capabilities are listed in the ITC, they may not be
available in every semester.&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><img border="0" src="../../nirs/caution.gif" width="20" height="19">
 Caution: the atmospheric transmission and emission files currently used
        by the ITC have a resolution of 1nm and therefore produce telluric
        features substantially broader than the actual instrumental resolution,
        especially at R=5900 and 18000. The inter-line signal and noise
        calculations are correct.</i></p>

<h3><a name="detector">GNIRS Detector Properties</a> </h3>

<p>The four combinations of well depth and read mode (more specifically, the
number of non-destructive reads) define the minimum exposure time, read noise
and saturation limit. At this time, there is no checking
of saturation or that the specified exposure time is more than the minimum
allowable. </p>

<p>Values of the read noise and minimum exposure times are given on the GNIRS <a href="../../nirs/nirsDetector.html"> science detector</a> page. </p>

<p>Dark current: laboratory characterisation indicates a value of 0.1e-/s at
the adopted operating temperature. This may include some internal cryostat background
(e.g. a low-level light leak).</p>

<h3>GNIRS On-Instrument Wavefront Sensor</h3>

<p>At&nbsp;this time, the GNIRS OIWFS is not available. Select the facility Peripheral Wavefront Sensor is
required for tip-tilt image stabilisation.</p>
