<p>The observing condition constraints define the poorest conditions
under which a queue-scheduled observation should be executed and
indicate the conditions that can be expected by classically-scheduled
observers. See the <a
href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/obsConstraints.html">detailed
translation</a> between <strong>frequency of occurrence</strong> (the
%-ile bin) and <strong>physical property</strong>, which is a function
of observing wavelength and zenith distance of the source. </p>

<p>Within the ITC, the selected constraint determines which of several
input files are loaded to define the sky transmission and emission,
and the image size adopted for the nominal point source. Links to
further details, or to the ASCII files themselves, are available here:

<ul>
  <li><b>Image quality</b> (see the <a
    href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/obsConstraints.html#Image Quality">detailed
    translation</a> for the meaning of the %-ile bins) </li>
  <ul>
    <li>The delivered image quality (<i>not</i> simply the seeing) is
      affected by many parameters including atmospheric properties
      (e.g. coherence length and time, scale length), wind speed and
      direction, guide star brightness and relative distance from
      target and observing wavelength. <b>The tabulated values of
      image quality assume zenith pointing</b>. As a first
      approximation, used in the ITC, the image size increases with
      air mass to the 3/5 power e.g. it is 50% larger at air mass =
      2. The wavefront sensor employed for tip-tilt image motion
      compensation, either peripheral or on-instrument, is selected in
      the ITC as part of the telescope configuration.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Sky transparency (cloud cover)</b> (see the <a
    href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/obsConstraints.html#Sky
    Transparency (Clouds)">detailed translation</a> for the meaning of
    the %-ile bins) </li> <li><b>Sky transparency (water vapour)</b>
    (see the <a
    href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/obsConstraints.html#Sky
    Transparency (Water)">detailed translation</a> for the meaning of
    the %-ile bins)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>optical <i>(spectrum not yet available)</i></li> <li>near-IR
    (0.9-5.6µm coverage, resolution 1nm, sampled every
    0.5nm). Selected spectra and data files are <a
    href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/ocTransSpectra.html#Near-IR">available</a>
    for 20%-, 50%- and 80%-ile conditions at air masses of 1, 1.5 and
    2.</li> <li>mid-IR (6-28µm coverage, resolution 1nm, sampled every
    0.5nm). Selected spectra and data files are <a
    href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/ocTransSpectra.html#Mid-IR">available</a>
    for 20%-, 50%-, 80%-ile and &quot;any&quot; conditions at an air
    mass of 1.5.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Sky background</b> (see the <a
    href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/obsConstraints.html#Sky
    Background">detailed translation</a> for the meaning of the %-ile
    bins) </li>
  <ul>
    <li>optical: <i>spectrum not yet available</i></li> <li>near-IR:
    0.9-5.6 µm coverage, resolution 2cm<sup>-1</sup>. An example
    spectrum and data file are <a
    href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/ocSkyBackground.html#near-IR
    (1-2.5µm) sky background">available</a></li> <li>mid-IR: the water
    vapour column and airmass are taken into account by the ITC in
    calculating the mid-IR sky background, and it need not be explicitly
    defined here. The sky background should be set to "any" for mid-IR
    observations in the PIT and OT, except perhaps in cases where
    optically-dark skies are needed to guide on a faint guide star for
    a high-priority target.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Air mass</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>This is the typical air mass (i.e. 1 / cos[zenith distance])
      expected during the observation.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
