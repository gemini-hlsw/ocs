<p>Each new calculation will post results into the same page. The results page can be printed and
re-sized e.g. so that the ITC form and results are both visible on your screen.&nbsp; </p>

<p><font size="+1">Image Size and Aperture </font></p>

<p>The <b> derived image size</b> (FWHM of the assumed Gaussian PSF) includes
contributions from seeing, telescope diffraction, the performance of the
tip-tilt secondary and many other components. See the image quality predictions
in the <a href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/obsConstraints.html">observing
condition constraints</a> for more details of the wavelength dependence and
frequency of occurrence.&nbsp;For the adaptive optics case both the FWHM of the
AO-corrected core and the FWHM of the uncorrected halo are given, as is the
Strehl ratio. </p>

<p>The <b>&quot;optimum aperture&quot;</b> size is described on the <a href="ITChelpMethods.html#analysis">analysis
methods page</a>. </p>

<p>For&nbsp;most <b>uniform surface brightness</b> (USB) calculations, the
(assumed circular) software aperture corresponds to an area of 1 arcsec^2 when
the &quot;optimum aperture&quot; analysis option is selected. (A different value
can be specified by the user and the point source size is also reported for
reference). However in the case of the <b>GMOS IFU</b>, the &quot;optimum
aperture&quot; option corresponds to a single IFU spatial element (not
1 arcsec^2) and the spectra from that IFU fiber (nominally 5 detector rows) are summed.
No optimal extraction or deconvolution is performed at this time. </p>


<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p><font size="+1">Format of imaging and spectroscopic results</font></p>

<p>In imaging calculations, the results page displays relevant derived properties on the top half
page and key user parameters at the bottom.&nbsp;For spectroscopic calculations the relevant signal, noise
and S/N characteristics are shown graphically.&nbsp; </p>

<p> If the final and single exposure S/N are
the same then only the former is visible.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In the cross-dispersed mode with GNIRS, the source signal and sqrt(background)
are color-coded for each order with dark and light shades of the same color.
Only the final S/N plot (i.e. not the single-exposure chart) is shown. </p>

<p>To <b>view (or save) the spectra as ASCII files</b> with tab-separated
columns, click (or shift+click) on the link(s) under each plot. The wavelength
units are nm; the ordinate has the same units as the graphics plot.&nbsp; </p>

<p><font size="+1">Signal to noise calculations</font></p>

<p>See the <a href="ITChelpMethods.html">calculation and analysis methods</a> for more
details on how the <strong>S/N for the whole observation</strong> is derived.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="+1">Error messages</font> - most are self explanatory; others: </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Can't find sourceGeom</strong> - usually occurs when trying to use the ITC from
Netscape 6.x which doesn't work with forms.
  </li>
  <li><b>Please use a model line width &gt; 1 nm to avoid undersampling of the 
  line profile when convolved with the transmission response</b> - the ITC
    currently samples the sky transmission spectrum, background and many other
    optical elements at 0.25-0.5nm resolution. Hence any model emission line
    that is narrower than 1nm may not be correctly propagated through the
    calculator.&nbsp;<BR><br>
