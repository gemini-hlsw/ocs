<p>The Gemini Integration Time Calculator (ITC) consists of a web form in which the user
defines the principal aspects of the observation and a Java servlet, resident on a Gemini
Observatory computer, which performs the calculation and generates the results. </p>

<p>The web form is divided into four sections: (1) the spatial profile, spectral shape and
brightness of the astronomical source, (2) the instrument and telescope configuration, (3)
the observing conditions and (4) methods of how the observation will be carried out and
the results analysed. There are additional help pages in each section that provide further
information (e.g. see the <em>more info</em> links within the form).</p>

<p>Within the form, the desired characteristics are defined by selecting radio buttons
(e.g. to choose between point or extended source), pull-down menus (e.g. to select the
units for source brightness) and text boxes to enter numerical values (e.g. for source
brightness). Clicking on the calculate button will post the user-defined values to the
servlet and create an output web page containing the results. Unavailable features are
indicated by red crosses.</p>

<p>The ITC is built around re-usable modules (e.g. for definition of the astronomical
source) and specific elements for individual instruments. There is a separate web form for
each instrument. Only the facility instruments listed above are supported; sensitivity
tables are available for visiting instruments on the relevant web pages. <a
href="ITCmodsBugs.html">Changes, enhancements and bugs</a> within the ITC are listed
chronologically. </p>

<p><img src="../caution.gif" width="20" height="19" alt="caution"> <b>Caution:</b> the ITCs
make some as yet unverified assumptions about telescope and instrument performance and
approximations for computational simplicity. Estimated accuracies will be posted as they
become available. The calculated integration times do not take overheads into account.</p>

<p>ITC performance: imaging calculations typically take 4s, spectroscopic calculations
take 10-20s, longer for large IFU calculations. (The calculation is the same in the
spectroscopic case as for imaging but generating the graphics
consumes 10-15s).</p>

<p>Please report <strong>any problems</strong> with the ITCs via the Gemini <a
href="http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/helpdesk/helpdeskIndex.html" target="_top">HelpDesk</a>.
</p>

<p>We are collecting a <a href="ITCwishlist.html">wishlist</a> of modifications and
improvements for possible inclusion in future releases. Please e-mail Bryan Miller (<a
href="mailto:bmiller@gemini.edu">bmiller@gemini.edu</a>) with suggestions (but use the
HelpDesk for questions!).</p>
