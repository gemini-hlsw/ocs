<h3><a name="optical">T-ReCS Optical Properties</a> </h3>

<p>The optical elements of T-ReCS (e.g. windows, filters, gratings and slits) are described in
detail on the <a href="../../miri/T-ReCSComponents.html">T-ReCS components</a>
pages. </p>

<h3><a name="detector">T-ReCS Detector Properties</a> </h3>

<p>v3.1 of the T-ReCS ITC includes the most recent detector characteristics
derived from the pre-ship Acceptance Testing. These tests indicated an
&quot;extra low frequency noise&quot; (ELFN) which effectively multiplies the
Poisson noise on the source and background flux by a factor of ~4. Further
measurements will be made during instrument commissioning.

<p>The individual exposure (a.k.a &quot;frame&quot;) time is fixed and not a
user-changeable parameter (unlike the total integration time). During normal
operation the frame time is set to optimally fill the wells and achieve
sensitive performance. For the purposes of ITC calculation the frame times used
are somewhat arbitrarily set to 0.02, 0.1 and 0.5s for imaging (all filters),
low-resolution spectroscopy (10 and 20um) and high-resolution spectroscopy,
respectively.

<h3>Spectroscopic resolution and sampling</a></h3>

<p>The ITC samples the spectral distributions at 10nm. However, the 
input source, background and transmission spectra may have a lower resolution, see description of 
the <a href="ITChelpAstroSource.html#spectral">spectral distributions</a> 
used by the ITC. Therefore, the output spectra from the ITC may not correctly 
reflect the resolution that can be achieved with T-ReCS.</p>
