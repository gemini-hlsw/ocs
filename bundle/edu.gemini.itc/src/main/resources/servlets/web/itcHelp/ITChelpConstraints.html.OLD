<p>The observing condition constraints define the poorest conditions under which a
queue-scheduled observation should be executed and indicate the conditions that can be
expected by classically-scheduled observers. See the <a
href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/obsConstraints.html">detailed translation</a>
between <strong>frequency of occurrence</strong> (the %-ile bin) and <strong>physical
property</strong>, which is a function of observing wavelength and zenith distance of the
source. </p>

<p>Within the ITC, the selected constraint determines which of several input files are
loaded to define the sky transmission and emission, and the image size adopted for the
nominal point source. Links to further details, or to the ASCII files themselves, are
available here: 

<ul>
  <li><b>Image quality</b> (see the <a
    href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/obsConstraints.html#Image Quality">detailed
    translation</a> for the meaning of the %-ile bins) </li>
  <ul>
    <li>The delivered image quality (<i>not</i> simply the seeing) is affected by many
      parameters including atmospheric properties (e.g. coherence length and time, scale
      length), wind speed and direction, guide star brightness and relative distance from target
      and observing wavelength. Note that the tabulated values of image quality assume zenith
      pointing. As a first approximation, used in the ITC, the image size increases with air
      mass to the 3/5 power i.e. it is 50% larger at air mass = 2. The wavefront sensor employed
      for tip-tilt image motion compensation, either peripheral or on-instrument, is selected in
      the ITC as part of the telescope configuration.</li>
