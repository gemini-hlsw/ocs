<p>Changes included in the v2.0 releases (issued 8 March 2002) are listed below.</p>

<p><b>Changes common to all ITCs:</b>
<ul>
  <li>User-defined source spectra can be used instead of the existing template
    and model SEDs. Note the following restrictions on file format:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Two space-separated columns: (1) wavelength in nm (2) flux density in
    arbitrary units. Files can have any number of comment lines, each starting
    with the # character, and any number of blank lines.</li>
  <li>Wavelength interval need not be uniform.</li>
  <li>Flux density must be in wavelength units (e.g. per nm or per um, but not
    per Hz).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Wavelength range must extend to include the requested normalisation filter
    (or wavelength). For example, a user-defined spectrum for T-ReCS must extend
    to below 2000nm if the source brightness is defined in the K-band.</li>
  <li>File size must be less than 1MB.</li>
 </ul>
  <li>80%-ile image quality degraded to provide better sampling of the range of
    expected conditions. The corresponding image size is defined in the <a href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/obsConstraints.html">observing
    condition constraints</a>.</li>
  <li>Cloud cover constraints for 70%-ile, 90%-ile and &quot;any&quot; bins
    changed to provide better sampling of the range of expected conditions. The
    corresponding transmission is defined in the <a href="../../../ObsProcess/obsConstraints/obsConstraints.html">observing
    condition constraints</a>.</li>
  <li>Input parameters are now reported in full at the bottom of the results
    page.</li>
  <li>Performance improvements of 35-40% for imaging and spectroscopy
    calculations were achieved.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;

<p><b>NIRI changes:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Transmission curves updated for several narrow-band filters {specify}</li>
  <li>Slid width and corresponding spectral resolution updated for 6-pixel
    center slit to match new physical slit. User interface now defines slit
    width in pixels (was in arcsec) to be consistent with PIT and OT and to
    avoid future updates when small changes are made.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;

<p><b>GMOS changes:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Size of IFU element corrected (hexagonal input aperture approximated by
    0.19 arcsec square; was 0.21 arcsec).</li>
  <li>Added radial range of IFU elements to extend previous single-element case.
    IFU elements have offsets of 0.20 arcsec. As before, the S/N is calculated
    for individual elements.</li>
  <li>All gratings (including those not currently installed) made available for
    ITC.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;

<p><b>AcqCam changes:</b>
<ul>
  <li>None</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;

<p><b>T-ReCS changes:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Integration time now specified explicitly, replacing specification using
    individual frame time and number of frames. As a placeholder, frame times of
    20ms and 100ms are assumed for imaging and spectroscopy calculations.</li>
  <li>Added non-stellar SEDs for planetary nebula, starburst galaxy, pre-main
    sequence star and the Galactic center. SEDs derived from ISO spectra.</li>
</ul>
