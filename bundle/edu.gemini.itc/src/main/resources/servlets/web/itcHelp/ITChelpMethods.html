<p>There are two modes available: 

<ul>
  <li>Calculate the total <strong>signal-to-noise ratio</strong> (S/N) for an observation with
    the specified exposure time, number of exposures and sky subtraction method </li>
  <li>Calculate the total <strong>integration time</strong> to achieve the requested S/N for
    an observation with the specified exposure time and sky subtraction method</li>
</ul>

<p>As the S/N can vary markedly with wavelength, particular in the infrared,
only the former mode is available for spectroscopic calculations.</p>

<p>The Integration Time Calculator reports the total signal and noise for a single
exposure and the <strong>signal-to-noise ratio</strong> (S/N) for a <strong>single
exposure</strong> and for the <strong>whole observation</strong>. In general, the
theoretical S/N (reported by the ITC as the &quot;<strong>intermediate S/N</strong>&quot;)
for a single exposure is not achievable because it is necessary to perform sky or
background subtraction. In practice there are many ways to achieve this subtraction
depending on the fequency of sky observations, the spatal extent of the object (e.g. it
may be necessary to observe separate sky frames in a crowded field or for an extended
object) and the personal preference of the observer. </p>

<p>The ITC uses an approximation that each on-source exposure measures both signal and
noise and that the process of background subtraction adds another contribution of noise.
(This is a generally applicable case; it can be shown that this approximation is within
0.5 to sqrt(3) of other approaches to background subtraction). In this case the final S/N
is:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="eqnMethodS2N.gif" alt="S/N algorithm" width="492" height="93"></p>

<p>where &quot;aperture ratio&quot; is (1 + source aperture area / sky aperture area). For
some instruments the aperture ratio may be defined by the user in the ITC; in others (e.g.
NIRI) it is fixed equal to unity at present. The 'sourceless noise' is defined as the
(quadratic) combination of background, readout and dark current noise:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="eqnMethodNoise.gif" width="547" height="73"
alt="sourcless noise equation"></p>

<p>where var(background) is the square of the backgound noise (i.e. the background flux)
etc. and the number of on-source exposures is:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="eqnMethodNexp.gif" width="624" height="47"
alt="number of exposures"></p>

<p>Several examples should clarify the behaviour of this algorithm. In each case we assume
that the source is faint so that the observation is (sky + telescope) backgound noise
limited and set the aperture ratio to 2. 

<ol>
  <li>Let the total number of exposures be 1. The ITC reports a final S/N that is worse than
    that derived intrinsically for the single exposure because it assumes background
    subtraction mst be performed.</li>
  <li>Let the total number of exposures be 4 all of which are on-source (e.g. we have offset
    the telescope but kept the target within the detector or slit field of view). The
    on-source integration time is <em>4t</em>. The final S/N is sqrt(2) better than an
    observation with 2 exposures (integration time <em>2t</em>) as we have doubled the
    on-source integration time.</li>
  <li>Let the total number of exposures be 4 but only 2 of which are on-source (e.g. we have
    offset the telescope to blank sky because the source is large or are
    chopping and nodding off-chip). The on-source integration
    time is <em>2t</em>. The final S/N is sqrt(2) worse than case (2) and the same as an
    observation with 2 on-source exposures.</li>
</ol>

<p>In both imaging and spectroscopy modes the signal and total noise is calculated within
a software aperture optimised to yield the best S/N ratio or within an aperture specified
by the user. The <strong>'optimum' aperture</strong> differs slightly for bright and faint
sources (i.e. it depends on the dominant source of noise) but an effective compromise over
a wide range of source brightness is 1.18 * FWHM for imaging a point source (see the notes
associated with the IRAF routine noao.astutil.ccdtime for further information). This
aperture contains 61% of the total signal for the assumed Gaussian PSF. (See the
more details of the default <a href="ITChelpAltairProperties.html">aperture used
in the AO case</a>). </p>

<p>In the case of a uniform surface brightness (USB) source the 'optimum' aperture simply
defaults to an area of one sq arcsec. Depending on the dominant source of noise, larger
apertures will typically give higher S/N in the USB case.</p>

<p>For spectroscopy, the equivalent length integrated along the slit that yields the best
S/N ratio would be 1.4 * FWHM for a Gaussian PSF. For computational simplicity, the ITC
rounds this length to an integer number of pixels.</p>

<p>When calculating the area enclosed by the software aperture in the imaging case, the
minimum is 9 pixels.</p>

<p>The ITC results page reports the aperture used by the software, the fraction of the
source flux it contains and the source + background signal in the peak pixel.<br>
